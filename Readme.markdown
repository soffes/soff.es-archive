# soff.es

This is my [website](https://soff.es). It’s pretty simple. My blog is at [blog.soff.es](https://blog.soff.es).

## Running Locally

Get the source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/soffes/soff.es.git
    $ cd soff.es

Get the dependencies:

    $ npm install

Now you can start the server:

    $ npm run dev

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see it running.

If you have issues getting it up and running, [send me an email](mailto:sam@soff.es).
