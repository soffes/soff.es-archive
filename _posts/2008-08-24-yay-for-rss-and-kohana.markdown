So I just put together some code real quick for building my RSS feed. I think I am finally going to make my own engine in [Kohana](http://kohanaphp.com) like I've talked about for so long.

I really need to write an admin panel or I know I wont use it. Hopefully I'll get time to do that soon. I guess I should add commenting too.
