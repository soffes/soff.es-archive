*So I am a huge [Quicksilver](http://blacktree.com) fan!* I use it constantly. You can do so much with it. Since I love keyboard shortcuts so much, so it's probably one of my favorite apps. It is the first thing I download and install when I get a new Mac.

Anyway, there is this thing called [Twitter](http://twitter.com/samsoffes) that is pretty cool. *I use it a lot.* I was thinking about something and remembered seeing a little action someone had written to twitter from Quicksilver. I thought I'd download it and try it out.

I must say, it's pretty cool. I still enjoy using my favorite client, [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com) more, but for posting something quick, it's kinda cool to use Quicksilver. I found [this script](http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver/) that enables Tweet as an action in Quicksilver. I thought It would be neat to add [Growl](http://growl.info) support to it (as it takes several seconds for it to actually work).

Here is my version: [Tweet.scpt](http://assets.samsoffes.com/files/Tweet.scpt)

To install it, just download that file and put it in `~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions/`. Now restart Quicksilver (bring it up and type command-control-Q) and you're golden. Just hit period to enter text editing mode, type your tweet, hit tab, start typing tweet, hit enter, and you've twittered! For the detailed instructions, [see the original script's page](http://blog.codahale.com/2007/01/15/tweet-twitter-quicksilver).
