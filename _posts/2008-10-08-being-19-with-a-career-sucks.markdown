title: Being 19 with a Career Sucks

So I'm 19 years old in case you didn't know. When I was 18, I moved across the country from Louisville, KY to Oklahoma City, OK for a sweet job. That was pretty crazy. I love my job at [LifeChurch.tv](http://www.lifechurch.tv/) on the [Digerati Team](http://lifechurch.tv/digerati/). While I've been here I worked on some pretty amazing projects like the [LifeChurch.tv website](http://www.lifechurch.tv/), [One Prayer](http://oneprayer.com/), and the [YouVersion Bible App](http://youversion.com/iphone) for the iPhone.

So along the way some pretty crappy stuff happened to me that I won't go into. If you remember, [my tweets](http://twitter.com/samsoffes) were real depressing for a bit around July. Anyway, life is good. I know there is some way better stuff for me in Oklahoma than what I have worked on so far.

The only thing is that I'm 19. Everyone I work with is way older than me and most of them are married with kids. Who does a 19 year old with a career hang out? I don't know any college kids because I don't go to college. Pretty frustrating right now.
