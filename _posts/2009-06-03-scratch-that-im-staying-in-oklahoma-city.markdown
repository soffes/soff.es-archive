So a few weeks ago I posted [that I was moving to Louisville](http://samsoff.es/post/moving-to-louisville). After having seconds thoughts and going back and forth on my decision, I'm going to stay here in Oklahoma City.

I wish I could be in both places. I have such great friends in both cities. Buying [a house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samsoffes/sets/72157616644807946/) is one of the things that is keeping me here.

I'm excited about a lot of things to come. Life is good.
