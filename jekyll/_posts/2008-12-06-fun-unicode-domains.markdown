title: Fun Unicode Domains

So recently I registered a few fun unicode domains. I think [http://♹.com/](http://xn--06h.com/) is my favorite that I registered. It took me awhile to figure out how to do it. I saw [http://☃.net/](http://xn--n3h.net/) on [iTod's twitter](http://twitter.com/iTod/status/1038641895) and it made me really want to figure out how to do it.

So the first thing to note is you don't actually register `♹.com`, but `xn--06h.com` instead. This is also difficult because a lot registrars don't let you register xn-- domains because it is reserved. xn-- means that it is [puny code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puny_code) encoded. Puny code is basically is a notation for encoding unicode characters into a more common character set.

So once I discovered that, all I had to do was [pick a fun combination character](http://www.technology.heartland.edu/courses/Computer%20Science/Programming/character_codes/unicode.html), [encode it into puny code](http://idnaconv.phlymail.de), and then register it. The registrar that I used was [Verio](http://www.verio.com/). Overall, I'm not a fan of them, but they were the only one that would let me register a xn-- domain.

So far, I've only seen [Safari](http://apple.com/safari) convert the xn-- in your address bar into the character or characters that it represents. It looks sweet in Safari, but everyone else will probably just be confused. It was a fun waste of an hour though.

**Update:** So Verio sucks. They messed up my order and never registered those domains I bought. Which is probably good. After I ordered them I was like, "Crap, I just spent $80." So it's all good.
