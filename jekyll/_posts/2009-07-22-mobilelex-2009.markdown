I spoke at the [Awesome Inc.](http://awesomeinc.org) Mobile miniConference in Lexington, KY over the weekend with [Jake Behrens](http://jakebehrens.com). About 100 people showed up for the event. I think its awesome that that many people have an interest in iPhone development in Lexington, KY. I did three sessions. My my two technical ones ("Scrolling Like Butter" and "Web Services with Cocoa") didn't have too many attenders, but "How I Made an App that Has Over a Million Users" seemed to be a hit.

### How I Made an App that Has Over a Million Users
This session was a non-technical overview of how to make a successful app. [Download slides PDF](http://download.samsoff.es/pdf/how-i-made-an-iphone-app-that-has-over-a-million-users.pdf).

### Scrolling Like Butter
This session was a technical discussion of how to make table views scroll well. See [Atebit's blog post](http://blog.atebits.com/2008/12/fast-scrolling-in-tweetie-with-uitableview/) for sample code and further reading. [Download slides PDF](http://download.samsoff.es/pdf/scrolling-like-butter.pdf).

### Web Services with Cocoa
This session was a technical discussion of how to optimize transferring data with SSConnection (which is now a part of [Four80](http://github.com/samsoffes/four80)). [Download slides PDF](http://download.samsoff.es/pdf/web-services-with-cocoa.pdf).
