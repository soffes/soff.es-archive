title: "Screencast: Reuse Code Across iPhone Applications with a Static Library and Git"
layout: post

A few of my friends have recently asked me how to share code between their applications. Here's a screencast walking you through how I solve this problem. It works really well for me. I hope this is useful to you.

<div class="video vimeo"><object width="620" height="465"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7699801&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=f05b35&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7699801&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=f05b35&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="620" height="465"></embed></object></div>

You can get my terminal shortcuts from my [dot files repo](http://github.com/samsoffes/dotfiles) on GitHub. You can also find the [test app](http://github.com/samsoffes/iphone-library-test-app) and [test library](http://github.com/samsoffes/iphone-library-test-library) on GitHub.

The [git submodule documentation](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html) might also be useful to you if you're new to working with submodules. If that's a little hard to understand (I know it is for me), just try googling it. There's a lot of good resources on submodules.
